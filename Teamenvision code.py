"""
Number Guessing Game
--------------------
The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 100.
Your task is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
After each guess, you'll get hints ("Too High" / "Too Low").
The game ends when you guess correctly.
You can play multiple rounds, and your best score (fewest attempts) is tracked.

How to Play:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your guesses when prompted.
3. Type 'exit' anytime to quit the game.
